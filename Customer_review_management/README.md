# Customer Data Management Sysytem
### This is a python based Graphical User INterface system that allows you to store, manipulate, edit and obtain customer related data using MySQL
All stores either big or small, all the places where there is an interaction between a consumer and seller/manufacturer, data of the bussiness or transactions is stored, whether it is done using excel spreadsheets or regularly maintained registers, comsumer data is really important for sellers as well as manufacturers, this provides them both with important insights into the purchase patterns and history of the consumers, which can thus help in understanding the demands as well as satifaction level of the products.

Here I code my own version of this Consumer Record/Review Data Management System, or you can call it CRM.\
The system has mainly two parts:
1. The Graphical User Interface constructed using the Tkinter library in Python.
2. The Database creation and management using MSQL.
(**Note:** here I use MSQL because it provides an easy connection and management of data through it's database management software protected by user defined password, which is known to the system and created at the time of installation of MySQL)

- GUI (Graphical User Interface):
For the GUI I constructed a system of multiple windows with different windos for specific task such as storing, retrieving/searching and deleting data, this can be easily achieved using Tkinter functions. Buttons, entry boxes and everything that you interact with is created using Tkinter.
- Database:
For database creation and management I run MySQL scripts in python, these scripts allow me to create a new database, and add to or create Tables into the database frame at my own will, data retrieval and editing is also made really easy with the application of MYSQL, with it's user defined cursor playing a major role.
